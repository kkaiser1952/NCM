NCM IS NOT A QSO LOGGER

The Net Control Manager (NCM) program was designed to make Amateur Radio Net check-ins, management of net resources and net reporting easier and more efficient than using pen and paper.

The NCM is designed to make ARES, RACES and other EM net logging and reporting as easy and intuitive as possible. Its many features are aimed squarely at these ideas.
NCM was also designed to be easily usable by the Net Control Operator (NCO) alone, however someone else keeping log while you control the net is always a good idea.

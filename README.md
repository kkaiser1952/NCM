# Net Control Manager
The Net Control Manager (NCM) program was designed to make Amateur Radio Net check-ins, management of net resources and net reporting easier and more efficient than using pen and paper. This is not meant however to be a replacement for pen and paper, which will always be your best backup should something go wrong.

The NCM is designed to make ARES, RACES and other EM net logging and reporting as easy and intuitive as possible. But of course works perfectly with your weekly club social net as well. Its many features are aimed squarely at these ideas.

NCM was also designed to be easily usable by the Net Control Operator (NCO) alone, however someone else keeping log while you control the net is always a good idea. I suggest you keep it open on your computer as you call the net. Set the timed refresh to 5 or 10 seconds. If the NCO is also the logger, do NOT set a timed refresh value.

Using NCM like any application of this type should be practiced. Go ahead and create a TE0ST net from the drop down. Add stations, delete stations, sort columns, edit fields, do all the things you would do during a real net. Then when you are complete be sure to close your net. This net will stick around for a while so come back and play with it more, re-open the net (right click the 'Net Closed' button) add some more calls, etc.

  <h2>Facility Nets</h2>
  <p>Facility Nets are designed to support a series of predefined locations, such as hospitals, across your coverage area. Each facility is expected to have an appropriate number of volunteers assigned to it.</p>
  
  <h3>Setting Up a Facility Net</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a group profile at <a href="https://net-control.us/BuildNewGroup.php">https://net-control.us/BuildNewGroup.php</a>, ensuring to select 'FACILITY' as the group type.</li>
    <li>Prepare a comma-separated values (CSV) file containing the facilities and their respective locations (latitude and longitude).</li>
    <li>Upload the CSV file to the NCM application.</li>
    <li>Configure the Facility Net settings, specifying the number of volunteers needed for each facility.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Managing Facility Nets</h3>
  <p>During a Facility Net, the Net Control Station (NCS) calls the net by facility name. Each station logs in, and their check-in is automatically associated with the corresponding facility. The logger can easily indicate if a station is physically present at the facility or reporting from another location.</p>

  <p>The Facility Net view provides a sorted list of facilities and their assigned volunteers, making it easier to track the status and location of each station.</p>

  <p>For more information or assistance with setting up a Facility Net, please contact the NCM support team.</p>

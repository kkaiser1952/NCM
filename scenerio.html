        <h2>Scenerio #1 Severe Weather</h2>
    <p>
        Its a little after 3pm on a very warm, late May evening, the NWS has just released a Tornado Watch for the immediate area. Jack with the local ARES group opens an informal net to asses the situation on the ground. Net Control Manager is opened as a 'Weather' net by Jack, he adds a comment to the 'General Comments' field "This is a standby net". He also copies and pastes the NWS bulletin to the same 'General Comments' field. Jack goes on to check in half dozen hams from their home locations, gathering information about their local weather and giving instructions to stand by. As time permits he enlists a backup NCO, an NCM logger and determines the availability of the hams to go out in the field if needed. Asking the newly assigned logger to comment each in the 'Time Line Comments' field for the individual. 
    </p><p>
        Half hour later NWS upgrades the watch to a warning, the local sheriff reaches out to the ARES group asking for communication support. The logger adds a new comment to the 'General Comments' field that the net is now an official severe weather net, and adds a copy of the NWS bulletin. In Jacks 'Time Line Comments' field he indicates which sheriff Jack talked with. Jack asks for additional check-ins to the net, where another half dozen or so hams check-in. A few minutes later the sheriff asks Jack if several hams could please report to a list of storm spotter locations.
    </p><p>
        The logger is now busy documenting the conversation or message into NCM, Jack asks for volunteers, assigns them a location, giving instructions to report when leaving home and on arrival at the assign location. Each ham does as directed, reports leaving home, which the logger documents in NCM, and upon arrival at their location they call into Jack giving him their what3words location. The logger enters each into the W3W column in NCM. And now everyone waits... Jack sees the purple menu bar on NCM turn Red he knows that is a 10 minute reminder, so he IDs the net and waits some more.
    </p><p>
        A few minutes later the ham at location 12 calls to report quarter size hail, but sees no cloud rotation at this time. Another calls and reports wind about 30mph with gusts at about 50mph. The NCM logger dutifully documents each report as they arrive, leaving Jack to control the net. About this time another ham checks-in reporting he is at W3W location 'happy,times,box' which the logger records as Jack acknowledges him. 
    </p><p>
        A request comes in from one of the hams on location, he is unfamiliar with the local area and needs to know where the nearest hospital is. Jack launches the 'Map This Net' report and displays both the ham and the nearest hospitals locations, and reports same advising where to go. Moments later another ham calls in to report a tornado on the ground about one quarter mile north. Because Jack has NCM open, and because the ham had given his W3W location which provides the nearest cross streets, he is able to quickly report it to the NWS. The logger has documented all conversations between Jack and the ham and Jack and NWS.
    </p><p>
        At the end of the emergency, as he did during it Jack does a wellness check on each of his hams. As they report in and are told they can go home, the logger puts "going home", or "headed home" into the appropriate comment field. On their arrival at home each checks in again with jack, and the logger documents "@ home" or "at home" in the comment field. One ham however did not acknowledge Jacks call, so the logger had changed his status in NCM to "MISSING" this hi-lites the entire row in red as a flag for Jack to follow up on. 
    </p><p>
        About now Jack receives permission from the sheriff to stand down his team. The logger notes that the net is now in clean-up mode by placing documentation in the 'General Comments' field saying as much. Jacks job is not yet done. He still has a "MISSING" ham to locate, additional calls are made with no luck. Finally a phone call is made to the ham and he is found. He's also advised to check out when leaving a net. All this is documented by the logger.
    </p><p>
        When given permission by Jack the logger closes the net, this makes the ICS-214 report available to Jack or anyone else who might need it.

        <h2>Scenerio #2 The Weekly Meeting</h2>
    <p>
        Seven PM Tuesday evening the weekly ARES two meter net is about to start. NCO Jack, opens NCM creates the empty net in three clicks. But this is going to be a training net focused on the ability for stations to pass traffic between themselves using simplex only.
